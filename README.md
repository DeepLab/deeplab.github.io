To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter below but edited to refect your title and the correct date.

Also please add in categories your name without spaces 'addiewagenknecht' for example, and what kind of post you're doing, i.e. how-to, information, research, art, etc
